// Binary Heaps and Tries are forms of trees that are used to implement priority queues (queues that aren't necessarily FIFO)

// In a Binary Heap, every node is greater than or equal to its children
// similarly a binary heap can be a min heap or a max heap, depending on the value of the root node
// if you insert a value to a binary heap and it is bigger than the root node, they have to be switched in order to maintain the validity of heap (rootNode > childrenNodes)
// Note: the heap data structure is not to be confused with memory heap

// a trie is a specialized tree focused on strings
